# Setup Development ToolChains

*redi* use decorator syntax so in tsconfig.json files, `experimentalDecorators` should be enabled. Make sure that it is TypeScript who transpile your sources not Babel, since Babel cannot transpile the syntax correctly.

## Scaffold

Sounds tedious to setup dev environment? Try our official scaffold [redi-starter](https://github.com/hullis/redi-starter).

* Out-of-box dev environment with React, TypeScript, webpack, ESLint and prettier.
* Build from differently entries and ship different bundles on different devices.
